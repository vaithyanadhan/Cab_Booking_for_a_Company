The Cab Booking System is a user-friendly web application developed to streamline the process of booking rides for company employees. Built using Flask (Python), MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the system enables users to register, log in, book rides, track cab availability, view ride history, and manage their wallet balance. Drivers can log in, update availability, accept ride requests, and track their earnings based on completed or canceled rides. The system features automated driver assignment based on pickup location and supports a flexible refund policy depending on whether a driver has been assigned. With real-time ride tracking, admin monitoring capabilities, and an interactive user interface, this project provides a secure, scalable, and efficient solution for managing corporate transportation services
